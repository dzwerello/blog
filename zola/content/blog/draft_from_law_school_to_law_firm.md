From Law School to Law Firm : Finding your Footing as an Articling Student 


Before I started my first articling role, I found myself explaining to people what I had read in many articles and heard from many people - that articling is bridging the gap between theory and practice. But, two months into my articles and I can say that I didn't expect the gap to be quite so large. 


case law vs managing cases


One of the starkest differences between law school and legal practice is the **incompleteness of cases**. In law school, part of the excitement—at least for me and many of my classmates—came from studying case law. The most engaging professors had a way of making cases feel like episodes of a legal drama, keeping us hanging on every twist and turn.


In practice, especially in family law, I quickly realized that we rarely get the full story. Unlike in law school, where we analyze cases after they have been decided, in practice, we are often working on cases **as they unfold**—with no clear resolution yet in sight. When I first started drafting case conference briefs and reading client files, I would read a client’s statement and think, _This seems straightforward—the opposing party’s position is completely unreliable_. Then, I’d read the opposing party’s answer materials and realize… _Oh right. These facts are disputed. We really don’t know what’s true yet_.


shifting from an academic perspective, where we analyze all the facts in a decided case, to a practical perspective, where we must determine which facts are **legally relevant** before the case is even resolved.


The reality of court appearances 


 In law school one of the reasons I was hesitant to go into family law, thinking that the bulk of your cases would go to trial, and as a young lawyer I felt very intimidated by that. 
What I hadn’t realized is how many **other** court appearances and settlement opportunities exist before a case ever reaches trial—if it even ever goes to trial. Family law, for instance, involves **first appearances, case conferences, motions, settlement conferences, trial-ready conferences, trial management conferences, and the potential for additional To be Spoken to appearances in between**. Not only do these hearings happen months apart, but it’s also common for matters to be adjourned, leading to even longer delays, or resolved at any stage along the way.

I had pictured legal practice as a constant scramble—frantically gathering evidence, preparing for trials, and working around the clock to build cases. While this may be the reality for some, I was relieved to learn that much of legal practice, particularly in family law, is **more structured and manageable than I expected**.



Lessons Learned: Staying Organized and Adapting to the Unexpected
 You learn your clients case as you go, and as long as you are an organized individual who uses calendars and understands roughly how long certain tasks will take, it is very manageable for even a sole practitioner to handle hundreds of clients by herself, and with the help of a law clerk. I am articling solely in family law at this time and so that applies to the law i am practicing but I can also see how employment law or corporate law may have issues that have very pressing time lines that come up the last minute too. 


A key takeaway from this transition is that **you don’t need to know everything about a case all at once**—you learn it as you go. As long as you are organized, use calendars effectively, and have a realistic understanding of how long certain tasks take, managing multiple cases becomes much more feasible. I have seen firsthand how even a sole practitioner, with the support of a law clerk, can handle hundreds of clients.


Of course, different practice areas come with different demands. While family law cases often progress over time, areas like employment law or corporate law may have more urgent deadlines and last-minute issues. The key is learning how to **adapt to the unexpected** while staying grounded in solid organizational skills.


As I continue my articling journey, I know there will be many more surprises ahead. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned so far, it’s this: **the transition from law school to legal practice is daunting—but entirely doable**.


A call for more Open Conversation 


At the firm where I am articling, new clients are constantly reaching out for consultations, which speaks to the firm's established reputation and strong referral network. However, this also raises a question that many new lawyers, including myself, grapple with: _How do I build this kind of client base when starting out?_


Through conversations with other lawyers, I have learned that referrals play a major role in client acquisition. Many established practitioners receive a steady flow of clients through word-of-mouth, whether from past clients, other lawyers, or professional connections. But for a new lawyer—especially one starting out as a sole practitioner—building this network takes time. Without an existing client base or a history of successful cases, gaining trust and visibility in the legal community can be a slow process.


This makes me wonder: _What are the most effective ways for new lawyers to build a strong client pipeline?_ Is it through networking, joining professional associations, or leveraging social media and legal directories? While law school teaches us legal principles and advocacy skills, the business side of running a practice is something many of us have to figure out as we go.


I have also noticed that different practice areas come with different challenges in client acquisition. For instance, in family law, many clients seek legal assistance during emotionally charged situations, making referrals and reputation even more important. Meanwhile, in corporate or employment law, long-term client relationships and repeat business might play a greater role.


This raises an important question for both new and experienced lawyers: What strategies have proven most effective in attracting and retaining clients? Engaging in more open discussions about business development—whether through mentorship, legal conferences, or professional organizations—could help new lawyers navigate this challenge and build a sustainable practice.
