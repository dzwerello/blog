<u>**How your Principals Practice System Shapes your Perspective**</u> 


One of the biggest factors shaping a young lawyer’s transition from articling to practice is _who_ they learn from. The lawyer I work for has a structured and organized approach to managing her caseload, and seeing this system in action has given me confidence in handling multiple files, court appearances, and deadlines. However, conversations with newly called lawyers—particularly those starting out as sole practitioners—have shown me a very different perspective. Many of them express concern about growing their client base or expanding into new practice areas, not because they lack knowledge, but because they fear becoming overwhelmed by the workload, especially with managing in-person court appearances.


For me, the fear is almost the opposite. Having observed an efficient system for managing files, scheduling court dates, and staying on top of client matters, I know that the workload itself is manageable with the right structure in place. Instead, I find myself wondering: _If I start my own practice one day, will I have enough work to stay busy?_


This is where mentorship from experienced lawyers becomes invaluable. Many aspects of the articling experience are objective and remain consistent regardless of who teaches you. However, the business side of law can vary significantly depending on who you work for.  Many young lawyers receive little guidance on the business side of law—how to attract and retain clients, build a professional network, and develop a practice that is sustainable in the long term. Without these insights, new lawyers may either struggle to take on enough work or become overwhelmed by taking on too much without the right systems in place.


As I continue on my own journey, I have found immense value in engaging in conversations on these topics with both fellow young lawyers and senior practitioners. I encourage both young lawyers and experienced practitioners to engage in discussions about what they wish they had known, what worked for them, and how they adapted to the evolving demands of legal practice. By sharing insights across generations, we can better prepare new lawyers for long-term success in the profession.


As I navigate the transition from law school to legal practice, I have realized how many pressing questions young lawyers face—questions that are not always covered in formal education or training. How do you effectively build a client base? How can lawyers begin to expand their practice areas and is being a sole practitioner with multiple practice areas realistic?  What are the most effective ways to build your legal network? How common are referrals, and how do you build up referrals?


To help bridge this gap, I have created a section on my website called Ask & Learn, dedicated to compiling and answering some of the most common and pressing questions young lawyers face. While I am actively researching these topics, I recognize that the most valuable insights often come from those who have already navigated these challenges firsthand.


I invite seasoned practitioners to contribute by sharing their knowledge—whether by answering specific questions posted in my column, providing practical advice, or offering guidance.
