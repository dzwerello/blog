Questions I am currently investigating:

- How do you effectively build a client base, specifically as a young lawyer?
- How can young lawyers begin to expand their practice areas? For context, I am currently articling in Family Law only law firm, but I would be interest in expanding into area such as Employment Law or Intellectual Property Law.
- Is being a sole practitioner with multiple practice areas realistic? For context, when speaking with one newly called lawyer in family law, he also expressed an interest in expanding into other fields but stated that he doesnâ€™t believe that doing so would be doable or realistic given the number of family law hearings etc.
- What are the most effective ways to build your legal network?
- How common are referrals, and how do you build up referrals? for context, I understand that one way to build up your client base is through referrals from other lawyers and firms.
